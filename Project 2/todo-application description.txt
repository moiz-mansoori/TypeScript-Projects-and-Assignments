I recently developed a command-line To-Do List application using TypeScript and the readline module. The app allows users to:

. Add tasks to the list
. Remove tasks by specifying their index
. Mark tasks as completed
. View all tasks with completion status
. The core functionality is built around object-oriented programming principles with a simple user interface. This app runs in a continuous loop, handling commands like add, remove, complete, and view in real time. ðŸ’¡

 Building this project has strengthened my TypeScript skills, especially working with custom types, classes, and input/output handling.

Check out the code !!
