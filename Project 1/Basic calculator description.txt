ðŸ”¢ Basic Command-Line Calculator using TypeScript ðŸ”¢

I recently built a Basic Calculator application using TypeScript and the readline module. This interactive command-line tool allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Key features include:

User-friendly input prompts for names, operations, and numbers.
Input validation to ensure only valid operations and numbers are processed.
Error handling for cases like division by zero.
The option to perform multiple calculations in one session.
Developing this project sharpened my TypeScript skills, particularly in input handling, data validation, and user interaction. ðŸ’»
